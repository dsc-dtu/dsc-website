                                    <p>DTU is a deemed university of this great nation.It also known for its placement record and SPC is an initiative which focus on students overall development to get them placed in their dream job. It stands for Student Placement Council and develop skills in students which is required for placements.
                                            SPC-DTU is going to make mock placements available to every student who applies, where all the renowned companies will participate. The only difference between original placement and these mock placements is that the executive taking interview will give you the feedback about you. Sounds interesting, isn’t it! Yes they will speak to you about your performance in interview and how can you overcome your weaknesses (like bad body language, about your dressing sense etc) during interviews.This is what will happen in the PLACEMENT FEST (in the month of January).
                                            Yes, it’s the best ever and the FIRST EVER placement fest ever occurring in DTU. This fest, unlike the others exposes the person to the real environment of placements which is most important in our college life. This fest will also expose you to personal training, GD, personal interviews, motivational speeches and a lot more.
                                            Every student here in DTU needs to know about placements. While, not knowing about it may land you a very good placement also, but why not have a proper training and experience first? After all “One with the sharpest saw cuts the tree better and fastest”. I hope that clears every doubt you happen to have about SPC in your mind.</p>

                            <h2>The Seven Habits -- An Overview</h2>    
                            <br />
                           
                            <p>We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.
                                    -- Aristotl
                                    Our character, basically, is a composite of our habits. "Sow a thought, reap an action; sow
                                    an action, reap a habit; sow a habit, reap a character; sow a character, reap a destiny," the
                                    maxim goes.
                                    Habits are powerful factors in our lives. Because they are consistent, often unconscious
                                    patterns, they constantly, daily, express our character and produce our effectiveness or
                                    ineffectiveness.
                                    As Horace Mann, the great educator, once said, "Habits are like a cable. We weave a
                                    strand of it everyday and soon it cannot be broken." I personally do not agree with the
                                    last part of his expression. I know they can be broken. Habits can be learned and
                                    unlearned. But I also know it isn't a quick fix. It involves a process and a tremendous
                                    commitment.
                                    Those of us who watched the lunar voyage of Apollo 11 were transfixed as we saw the
                                    first men walk on the moon and return to earth. Superlatives such as "fantastic" and
                                    "incredible" were inadequate to describe those eventful days. But to get there, those
                                    astronauts literally had to break out of the tremendous gravity pull of the earth. More
                                    energy was spent in the first few minutes of lift-off, in the first few miles of travel, than
                                    was used over the next several days to travel half a million miles.
                                    Habits, too, have tremendous gravity pull -- more than most people realize or would
                                    admit. Breaking deeply imbedded habitual tendencies such as procrastination,
                                    impatience, criticalness, or selfishness that violate basic principles of human effectiveness
                                    involves more than a little willpower and a few minor changes in our lives. "Lift off" takes
                                    a tremendous effort, but once we break out of the gravity pull, our freedom takes on a
                                    whole new dimension.</p>

                                            <div><strong>College</strong> is but one step in the path of success of a student. The shift from being a grade 12 student to becoming a first year student marks the beginning of what could probably be the most important phase in a student’s life. It is with the dreams of joining large companies, or creating their own companies that students take their first step into their colleges.</div>
                                            <div><strong>Some of the note worthy problems and mistakes that even 2nd years make are:</strong></div>
                                            <div>1) Not utilizing time of bunks effectively.</div>
                                            <div>2) Over spending time with friends.</div>
                                            <div>3) Not learning any new skill. Not exploring new things.</div>
                                            <div>4) Not expanding friend circle. Keeping to only single friend circle.</div>
                                            <div>5) Not studying for exams until the D day arrives.</div>
                                            <div>6) Traveling for hours to reach college. Not taking a PG.</div>
                                            <div>7) Going home every saturdays', every other holidays.</div>
                                            <div>8) Not staying in college after 5 pm for extra curricular activities.</div>
                                            <div>9) Copying assignments and having excessive mass bunks.</div>
                                            <div>10) Spending too much time on social media.</div>

                                            <div>12) Having a large ego in front of teachers and thinking that teachers know nothing and thus disrespecting them.</div>
                                            <div>13) Taking the first year for granted.</div>
                                            <div>14) For studious students, doing only studies and not taking time out for work of a society.</div>
                                            <div>15) Ignoring advice of seniors.</div>
                                            <div>As a first year, some problems may not click to you or may not exist but when you observe, you can clearly see one of your friend do it.</div>

However, at the same time, the massive workload and daily grind of the 4 years, couple with lack of guidance and aid quickly distracts and demotivates the students. Low on confidence and unaware of their potential, they lose sight of their aim of getting placed in a worthy company.</div>

                                            <div>It is this very problem that has led to the creation of <strong>SPC-DTU</strong>, a team aimed at helping students become aware of the placement process and the various details that one must keep in mind when sitting for placements. Anyone who participates in the placement fest will definitely find themselves in a position to properly develop themselves so that they can give their best performance in their placement and bag the best jobs.</div>

                                                Project-based learning focuses on <strong>developing critical thinking</strong> and <strong>problem solving skills</strong> in the students. Its inquiry-based method of learning to solve the problems given as projects to the students is a style of active learning. In short, we can say “Project-Based Learning integrates knowing and doing” when student apply what they know to solve authentic problems with intentions to produce results that matter.
                                                
                                                A project has scope of work, resource, and planning activity to execute and manage resourceσ to get the desired results. In the present world of full of ever increasing complexity, project-based learning is preparing students to solve the real world problems. Here are 12 reasons why you as teachers, guides, educators, educationists, or students should go for project-based learning.
                                                <h4><strong>1. End-To-End Problem-Solving Skills</strong></h4>
                                                In project-based learning students undergo various stages of problem solving through structure of the project which include various stages like project scoping, work planning, activity performing and tracking, managing uncertainties presented during problem solving activities of the project, presentation of the project, and closure. Students have opportunities to develop skills of observation, survey, research, reporting, presentation, communication, and collaboration with people involved, team building, and leadership in the end-to-end problem solving approach of project-based learning.
                                                
                                                <strong>3. Real World Problem Simulation</strong>
                                                
                                                Project-based learning focuses on enabling student to face real world situations simulated in the forms of the projects. Students learn while doing what they know and develop new learning around hobbies, passions, and careers. They often develop new hobbies, passions, and liking for new careers.
                                                <h4><strong>4. Scope Of Work</strong></h4>
                                                The first and foremost reason to go φορ project-based learning is that it enables educators, teachers, and students to learn and adopt structures around projects rather than having lecture-based learning and reading-writing assignments of the traditional classed room learning. Students learn to comprehend the entire scope of the project and put the execution into a structure under guidance of their teachers or supervisors.
                                                <h4><strong>5. Improves The Interpersonal Skills Of A Student</strong></h4>
                                                It greatly impacts the development of interpersonal skills of the students. Projects given often are more complex than in the assignments given in the traditional classroom-based learning. Students need to structure their efforts in organizing their survey required for the projects, analyze the survey results, and prepare reports to reach markets and collaborates with sponsors of the projects. In the entire approach or different stages of the project they improve their communication skills to collaborate with various stakeholders.
                                                <h4><strong>6. Concept And Creativity Development</strong></h4>
                                                Project-based learning develops greater depth of understanding the concepts than in traditional classroom-based learning and results in improved levels of student’s creativity. Real world situations given in the project are more capable to draw students’ attention and capture their interest to provoke the needed level of thinking to apply new knowledge in a problem solving context.
                                                <h4><strong>7. Determines The Actual Knowledge</strong></h4>
                                                Project-based learning determines in depth knowledge and experience of the students and sometimes of teachers in comparison to the fixed length of learning experience of traditional classroom-based learning. In project-based learning student develop their skills and knowledge while classed-based learning has shorter span of memorizing based experience derived from a rote approach.
                                                <h4><strong>8. Choice Of Selecting Real World Problems</strong></h4>
                                                Another great reason to go for project-based learning is that projects are chosen by the students or assigned by the teachers according to the students’ interest. Students are presented to have choice based on their interest in selecting a real world problem presented in the project. Interest-based selection of projects gives student unique ways of solving different problems which are diverse even in the same class, where as traditional classroom-based learning has question/answer-based essays and exam writing, including assignments given to all students of the class.
                                                <h4><strong>9. New Style Assessment Of Students’ Skills</strong></h4>
                                                Teachers are able to assess students’ capabilities to observe, survey, and investigate, then allocate the projects determining the activities and events based on their interest. Students find themselves capable of honing their observation and analyzing skills. Teachers can directly assess the development of these skills among their students when they perform activities of the project work.
                                                <h4><strong>10. Visits To Field-Sites Of Real World Problems</strong></h4>
                                                A significant feature of project-based learning is field-site visits by the students, teachers, and other involved researchers and educationists as needed in the project executions which open new ways of learning and collaborating with stakeholders and new people.
                                                <h4><strong>11. Direct Demonstration Of The Capability</strong></h4>
                                                Teachers get greater opportunity to assess their students’ capabilities demonstrated in the performing activities and events organized in the projects than the essays. And exams of the traditional classroom learning based on rote learning and memorization to write what teachers have taught as their fixed and pre-determination of the topic or subject.
                                                <h4><strong>12. Technology Inclusion</strong></h4>
                                                Project-based learning is an effective way of including technology in the learning laboratories of the education system. Projects selected by students according to their interest are now likely to involve computers and the internet, as well as interactive whiteboards, GPS devices, and cameras.
                                                <h4><strong>13. Tracking Of Progress</strong></h4>
                                                In project-based learning teachers and students both can track their activities involved in the project given to the student to solve real world problems. In traditional classroom-based learning this is ever missing, as not required or non-existing mechanism in the structure.

                                                <h3><strong>Final Word</strong></h3>
                                                Giving a project to students is better nowadays. Rather than just making them sit in a class and speaking it all out for them is bad. This makes the children go out on their own and learn on their own. This gives them a better understanding of the topic. This way, students will learn to take up an initiative on their own and know more on their chosen topics. Gaining knowledge should be fun and interesting, where children should engage themselves in a world of facts.

                                                    Resumes reach more effectively through referrals. On-campus recruiting and general scouting by Google HR are other ways this happens.

                                                    </ul>
                                                    A lot of factors are considered while doing this –<em>grades</em> (for freshers), <em>college, degree</em>, <em>past work experience </em>(most important for experienced candidates), <em>internships, projects/thesis or work etc.</em>
                                                    
                                                    <strong><em> </em></strong>
                                                    <ul>
                                                         <li><strong>Phone screening(s): </strong>this might be skipped for a very strong resume or referrals.</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                    But (especially for outstation candidate) Google normally conducts 1or more usually 2 phone screenings.
                                                    
                                                    When answering coding questions, you’ll talk through your thought process while writing code in a Google doc that you have to share with your interviewer. During the interview you’ll be asked question upon data structure and algorithm. You must be prepared to write a 20-30 lines of code during the interview. The code must be clean, rich and robust.
                                                    
                                                    Behavioural, hypothetical, or case based question can also be asked. The aim of these interviews is primarily to determine whether the candidate should be called to Bangalore or Hyderabad for onsite interview.
                                                    
                                                    <strong> </strong>
                                                    <ul>
                                                         <li><strong>ONSITE INTERVIEW:</strong> These are hardcode technical interviews which test the candidate on algorithms, problem solving, data structures, coding in either Java, C++ or Python, basics of unit testing, systems and raw smarts. The emphasis might be on different things depending on actual job profile and interviewers.</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                    <strong>           </strong> After 2 interviews, a short feedback is taken from the interviewers and the HR decides whether to proceed on the spot. If yes, 2 more interviews are taken and the candidate is sent back. A lot of emphasis is made on unbiased feedback from interviewers and each interviewer is completely unaware of the candidate's performance in other interviews.
                                                    
                                                    HR goes through the 4 feedbacks and decides whether to proceed or not. Its important to understand that in each interview question, the final answer is not as important as the approach and the discussion. The ability to work on hints from the interviewer and iterative thinking are other critical things apart from stuff mentioned above. The biggest red flags are coding inability and getting hopelessly stuck at a step even after several hints.
