                                <strong>Importance of College Education</strong><br>
                                People who lack educational degrees are more likely to be limited to basic jobs in service, manufacturing and construction industries. While employees with a high school education may secure jobs with good benefits, college graduates typically fare better, entering higher-level careers with greater salaries. They are also more likely to receive promotions, earn raises and develop reasoning and communication skills that can be applied to their jobs.
                                <br>
                                <strong>Higher Salaries</strong><br>
                                A college education may be one of the best investments of time and money for a person's career. A 2011 report produced by the Indian Community Survey that was released by the U.S. Census Bureau stated that those who held a bachelor's degree were expected to earn a 40-year lifetime salary of about $2.4 million dollars on average, while high school graduates only took a lifetime salary of about 20 Lakhs rupees (www.census.gov). On average, those who held master's degrees earned $2.5 cr rupees. Holders of professional degrees could expect lifetime earnings in excess of $4 million dollars.
                                <br>
                                <strong>Better Life Skills</strong><br>
                                During their classes, college students often develop the reasoning skills needed to make life decisions, ranging from buying a home to helping their children choose their own college. In fact, college graduates are more likely to have children who also complete a college education. Other advantages of educational degrees may include improved self-discipline, study habits and cooperative behaviors that can be applied to career projects and tasks.

                            <h2>The Seven Habits - An Overview!</h2>
                            <h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> Post by Abhinav Rastogi, Dec 12, 2017.</h5>
                            <h5><span class="label label-danger">Food</span> <span class="label label-primary">Ipsum</span></h5><br>
                            <p>We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.
                                    -- Aristotl
                                    Our character, basically, is a composite of our habits. "Sow a thought, reap an action; sow
                                    an action, reap a habit; sow a habit, reap a character; sow a character, reap a destiny," the
                                    maxim goes.
                                    Habits are powerful factors in our lives. Because they are consistent, often unconscious
                                    patterns, they constantly, daily, express our character and produce our effectiveness or
                                    ineffectiveness.
                                    As Horace Mann, the great educator, once said, "Habits are like a cable. We weave a
                                    strand of it everyday and soon it cannot be broken." I personally do not agree with the
                                    last part of his expression. I know they can be broken. Habits can be learned and
                                    unlearned. But I also know it isn't a quick fix. It involves a process and a tremendous
                                    commitment.
                                    Those of us who watched the lunar voyage of Apollo 11 were transfixed as we saw the
                                    first men walk on the moon and return to earth. Superlatives such as "fantastic" and
                                    "incredible" were inadequate to describe those eventful days. But to get there, those
                                    astronauts literally had to break out of the tremendous gravity pull of the earth. More
                                    energy was spent in the first few minutes of lift-off, in the first few miles of travel, than
                                    was used over the next several days to travel half a million miles.
                                    Habits, too, have tremendous gravity pull -- more than most people realize or would
                                    admit. Breaking deeply imbedded habitual tendencies such as procrastination,
                                    impatience, criticalness, or selfishness that violate basic principles of human effectiveness
                                    involves more than a little willpower and a few minor changes in our lives. "Lift off" takes
                                    a tremendous effort, but once we break out of the gravity pull, our freedom takes on a
                                    whole new dimension.</p>

                            <h2>How to face stage fear?</h2>
                            <h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> Post by Ashish Gupta, Dec 12, 2017.</h5>
                            <h5><span class="label label-danger">Food</span> <span class="label label-primary">Ipsum</span></h5><br>

                                    Imagine standing at the tribune, a couple of seconds before you actually start delivering your speech. Think of the moment when you stand behind the mic, just before the first line of the song you want to perform for the crowd. How does it feel? Are you full of happy excitement or feel like running away (if only you could do it on those shaky legs)? In case it makes you feel any better – John Lennon used to throw up before his live performances. You're not alone in the struggle. Plus, we're going to make your life a lot easier by offering the tips to fight the fright.
                                    
                                    It's Not About You
                                    
                                    One of the most common reasons of a stage anxiety is worrying what the audience is going to think about you. Well, here's a fun fact: they don't really care about your personality. Most of the time people are worried only about themselves. You are to engage, educate or entertain your audience. If they are satisfied with what they get, they won't judge the one who delivers it too hard. Thus, concentrate on the material you're going to present instead of focusing on your personality.
                                    
                                    Practice
                                    
                                    Practice makes perfect. The rule applies to almost every sphere of our lives, right? Public speaking is not an exception. Training for your performance you make things easier for your brain by reducing the number of unknown variables it has to deal with when the due date comes. This allows you to focus on your story, entertaining your reader and making the whole thing much more fun.
                                    
                                    Send Good Vibes
                                    
                                    Perception is everything, isn't it? That's why thinking of your audience as of a group of friendly, interested people, rather than a bunch of guys, ready to destroy you with criticism, will be of a great help. Smile and remember about eye contact. Avoid gazing at people, though: diverting your eyes to look at your notes or fix the appliances makes you look human, which is certainly good. We like the things we can relate to. Thus, looking not-so-perfect at times might even be a good thing.
                                    
                                    Don't Cram
                                    
                                    Sounding human and looking natural is crucial for successful delivery and impressing your listeners. That's why you don't want to learn every single word by heart, when it comes to delivering a speech. You surely are to know what goes after what and have some cards or the outline in front of your eyes. Memorizing every single word will make you sound robotic.
                                    
                                    If you are going to sing, act or dance in public – situation is a bit different. Here you'll seek for a certain degree of mechanization, where you know all the moves, cues or direction of the melody. Nevertheless, leaving some space for your soul and inspiration will help you and your audience enjoy the event much more.
